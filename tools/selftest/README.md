# Is the board still healthy?

A self-test for the Fishball7020 / PlutoSky. It answers one question — *has
this radio been damaged?* — and it answers it with measurements rather than
with "well, it still enumerates".

```bash
# run from: tools/selftest/
./sdr_selftest.py                 # no cable, never transmits
./sdr_selftest.py --loopback      # + the RF tests
```

Python 3.8+ and nothing else. `numpy` is used for the FFT if you happen to
have it and a pure-Python transform if you don't; the results are identical to
four decimal places, which `test_dsp.py` asserts.

## What it actually does, in plain terms

The board is a radio. This asks it a series of questions whose right answers are
known, and reports where reality departs from them.

Some questions need nothing connected — is the power supply the right voltage,
is the chip too hot, does the receiver respond when you turn its gain up. Others
need the transmit socket wired to the receive socket so the board can listen to
itself, which is called a **loopback**. In between them you must fit an
**attenuator** — a small inline part that weakens the signal by a fixed amount,
quoted in decibels — because the transmitter is far stronger than the receiver
can survive.

A few terms used throughout:

- **dB (decibel)** — a ratio, not an amount. 10 dB is ten times the power, 20 dB
  a hundred, 30 dB a thousand. They add, so two 10 dB attenuators make 20 dB.
- **dBFS** — how loud a received signal is relative to the largest the converter
  can represent. Always negative; −20 dBFS is a tenth of full scale.
- **dBc** — how far an unwanted signal sits below the wanted one. Bigger is
  better.
- **Noise floor** — the level of the background hiss. A signal is only useful if
  it is above this.
- **Attenuation / pad** — deliberate weakening. "A 30 dB pad" is a part that
  makes the signal a thousand times weaker in power.

## Two halves

### Without a cable — and without transmitting

| What it checks | What a failure means |
|---|---|
| Six Zynq supply rails against ±5% | a regulator has drifted or failed |
| Zynq and AD9361 die temperature | thermal path or a part drawing too much |
| **AD9361 digital-interface eye** — all 16×16 clock/data delays with a PRBS running | the LVDS link to the FPGA is marginal: a cracked joint, a degraded driver |
| **AD9361 internal digital loopback** — a tone through both DMAs and back | the FPGA datapath or either DMA is dropping data |
| Capture length, I/Q both live, DC offset | a stuck or dead converter |
| RX gain chain response over 70 dB | a front end that no longer amplifies |
| Both receive channels | one channel lost |
| Synthesiser tuning, 70 MHz – 6 GHz | a VCO band that no longer locks |

The two BIST checks need shell access to the board (`--ssh`), because they
live in debugfs and libiio does not expose them. They are the deepest tests
here and they need no cable, so they are worth the extra access. Without
`--ssh` they are skipped and everything else still runs.

### With a loopback — this transmits

```
TX1 ---[ 20 dB pad ]--- RX1        (bigger is safe too; 20 dB measures best)
```

| What it checks | What a failure means |
|---|---|
| Loop detected, and the path loss in it | an open connector, or a port that has gone deaf |
| **TX attenuator linearity** over 25 dB | compression, or a damaged output stage |
| **RX gain linearity** over 40 dB | a damaged gain stage |
| **Image rejection** | quadrature calibration, or an unbalanced mixer |
| **Harmonic distortion**, 2nd and 3rd | a non-linear output stage |
| **Path loss at 8 frequencies, 100 MHz – 5 GHz** | a band-specific hole: a blown balun or matching network |
| **How far the transmitter actually falls when stopped** | something is leaving the radio keyed |

## Safety

**This cannot overdrive your receiver, even if you forget the attenuator.**

The receiver is the fragile end: the AD9361's RX input is rated to about
**+2.5 dBm**. And this board is sold in a variant with a **power amplifier** on
transmit — a Mini-Circuits [PGA-102+](https://www.minicircuits.com/pdfs/PGA-102+.pdf)
whose gain runs from **17.7 dB at 50 MHz down to 10.4 dB at 6 GHz** (full
table in [Transmitter safety](../../docs/transmitter-safety.md), which is the
canonical copy). P1dB is about +17.5 dBm, and flat out the board should be
taken to deliver **about +19 dBm** — about **16 dB above what its own receive
port survives**. That is this script's own estimate, scaled up from a quieter
measurement and stopped at the amplifier's compression point, not a power
meter reading. Sizing a loopback for a bare AD9361, as most Pluto
advice does, gets this dangerously wrong.

So the script never transmits with less than **35 dB** of its own attenuation:

| | TX output | At RX with **no** pad | With a 50 dB pad |
|---|---|---|---|
| Script's floor, at its −6 dBFS drive | −16 dBm | **−16 dBm** | −66 dBm |
| Same floor, at full-scale drive | −10 dBm | −10 dBm | −60 dBm |
| Damage threshold | | **+2.5 dBm** | |

That is 12.5 dB of margin in the worst case that can be constructed — full
scale, highest PA gain, two ports joined by a barrel. Sweeps *start* at 50 dB,
measure the loop, and only then work downward toward the floor. A 25 dB span is
ample to prove the gain chain is linear, so there is nothing to gain from going
louder. `--min-tx-atten` can lower it and prints the resulting power budget.

**Use a single 20 dB pad for measuring.** Larger pads are just as safe, but
the board leaks a little transmit signal straight into its own receiver, and
the weaker the cable loop, the more that leak distorts the result. With 50 dB
on channel 0, above about 1.5 GHz the leak is as strong as the loop and the
frequency response reads up to 13 dB wrong. Through 20 dB it stays within
about ±2 dB. Measured in
[docs/measured-performance.md](../../docs/measured-performance.md#the-boards-own-tx-to-rx-leak).

**It also asks how much attenuation is in your cable**, then checks your answer
against what it measures and says so if the two disagree by more than 8 dB. A
pad that is missing, is the wrong value, or is not making contact is the
failure that destroys receivers, so it is worth one question.

That comparison has a useful side effect: the PA and non-PA variants of this
board differ by exactly the PA's gain, so a pad you are confident about tells
the script which one you have. It reports that too — measured here, a declared
50 dB pad reads back as 51 dB against the PA model and 35 dB against the
bare-AD9361 one, which settles it.

Other guarantees:

- **Nothing transmits without `--loopback`.** The default run never keys the
  radio at all.
- Every setting is saved at the start and restored at the end — including
  after Ctrl-C or an exception. The transmitter is muted *before* anything
  else is put back.
- The receiver is held around −22 dBFS and backed off if it approaches full
  scale, so measurements are never taken in compression.
- Every measurement reads back the gain and attenuation actually in force and
  re-asserts them if they have moved, so a setting that changes underneath the
  test is corrected and reported rather than silently corrupting a number.

**Do not run `--loopback` with an antenna on the TX port.** Most of this
board's range is licensed spectrum, and with the PA it is not a trivial
transmitter.

## Both channels

The board has two transmit and two receive ports. `--channel both` measures
pair 0, then asks you to move the loopback to TX2/RX2 and press Enter:

```bash
# run from: tools/selftest/
./sdr_selftest.py --ssh --loopback --pad 20 --channel both
```

With one set of attenuators you can only test one pair at a time, which is why
it prompts rather than assuming. `--channel 1` runs just the second pair.

## When the attenuator moves on its own

If a run reports *"settings changed on their own"*, look at `/mnt/jffs2`
before you suspect your board.

That partition is the one writable, persistent thing on a Pluto, and
`/mnt/jffs2/autorun.sh` runs at every boot. Anything started from there
survives reflashing the kernel, the device tree and the bitstream, and appears
nowhere in the firmware source however hard you look. A common helper watches
the transmit buffer and applies a working gain shortly after a stream starts:

```sh
# on the board: an example of what such a script contains - not something to run
ACTIVE_GAIN="-10.000000"
# on buffer/enable 0 -> 1:  sleep 2; iio_attr -o -c ad9361-phy voltage0 hardwaregain $ACTIVE_GAIN
# on buffer/enable 1 -> 0:  iio_attr ... hardwaregain -89.750000
```

Useful, and a genuinely confusing thing to debug: it fires once per stream,
only while streaming, a couple of seconds after the fact, and at a value
nothing in the kernel writes. It also **silently overrides whatever gain your
application set** — which matters with the PGA-102+ fitted, where 10 dB of
attenuation is roughly +13 dBm at the SMA against a +2.5 dBm receive port.

Two things here address it. Every measurement re-reads the gain and
attenuation, restores them if they have moved, and counts it — so results stay
correct and the interference is reported rather than silently folded into a
number. And `--ssh` lists `autorun.sh` and flags any script under `/mnt/jffs2`
that writes radio settings, up front:

```
== Board customisation ==
  info   /mnt/jffs2/autorun.sh runs at every boot
         /mnt/jffs2/tx_watchdog.sh &
  WARN   scripts here write radio settings
         /mnt/jffs2/tx_watchdog.sh
```

## Baselines

Some things have absolute answers: a supply rail is in spec or it is not, and
a gain slope that should be 1.00 dB/dB either is or is not. Those pass or fail
on their own.

Path loss does not. It depends on your cable and your attenuator, and on this
board also on a small leak from each transmitter straight into its own
receiver, which adds a fixed pattern that differs for every pad. So there is no
universal number to compare against. Record a
baseline while the board is known good:

```bash
# run from: tools/selftest/
./sdr_selftest.py --loopback --ssh --save-baseline ~/board-healthy.json
```

and compare against it whenever you suspect something:

```bash
# run from: tools/selftest/
./sdr_selftest.py --loopback --ssh --baseline ~/board-healthy.json
```

That turns *"is 41.6 dB of loss at 2.4 GHz correct?"* — unanswerable — into
*"it was 41.5 dB in March"*, which is the question you actually wanted. Use
the same cable and pad both times, or the comparison means nothing.

## Reading the output

```
== RF loopback ==
  PASS   loopback detected
         tone 68.3 dB above the floor at 900.0 MHz; TX attenuation 20 dB, RX gain 34 dB
  info   external attenuation in the loop
         about 30 dB (+/-3 dB). System gain -25.4 dB.
  PASS   image rejection
         48.2 dBc (image at -250 kHz is -70.4 dBFS)
```

"System gain" is the loop's transfer function with both programmable gains
divided out, so it describes the cable and the radio's analogue path and
nothing else. That is what makes it comparable between frequencies and between
runs months apart. The implied pad is derived from it using nominal figures
for this board, so treat it as ±3 dB — enough to tell a 20 dB pad from a 50 dB
one, or from a bare cable, which is all it is for.

Exit status is 0 if nothing failed, 1 if anything did.
