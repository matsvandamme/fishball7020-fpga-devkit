"""Health check for a Fishball7020 / PlutoSky board: is it still undamaged?

Two halves.

The FIRST half needs no cable and puts nothing on the air. It reads the
Zynq's own supply rails and die temperature, runs the AD9361's built-in self
test - the digital-interface eye scan and an internal loopback - and exercises
the receiver on its own. That is already enough to catch a failed regulator, an
overheating part, a marginal LVDS interface, a dead ADC, or a receiver whose
gain chain no longer responds.

One caveat on "puts nothing on the air": the internal loopback closes the loop
inside the chip, but it does run the transmit datapath to do it, at maximum
attenuation. Mute depth measures at least 75 dB here, so the port is at its own
noise floor - but the chain is live, not powered down. The eye scan is cleaner
still: the driver mutes TX for its duration precisely so the PRBS is not
radiated.

The SECOND half needs a cable from TX1 to RX1 with an attenuator in it, and
is the only part that transmits. It measures the loop end to end: level
linearity over the TX attenuator and the RX gain range, path loss across the
tuning range, image rejection, harmonic distortion, and how quiet the
transmitter really is when it is supposed to be off.

    TX1 ---[ 20 dB + 30 dB pad ]--- RX1        and TX2 ---[ pad ]--- RX2

Use at least 20 dB, and understand why: the receive input is rated to about
+2.5 dBm, and this board is sold in a variant carrying a PGA-102+ power
amplifier that delivers roughly +18.5 dBm - some 16 dB above what its own
receiver survives. A loopback with no attenuator in it will damage the board.
Sizing for a bare AD9361, as most Pluto advice does, is wrong by 10-18 dB here.

This script never starts loud: it begins at 50 dB of TX attenuation, measures
the loop, and only then works out how hard it may drive - never below 35 dB,
which holds it under -16 dBm even into a bare cable. It refuses to go anywhere
near full scale on the receiver. But it can only protect you from itself.

WHAT "PASS" MEANS. Some checks are absolute - a supply rail is in spec or it
is not, and a slope that should be 1.00 dB/dB either is or is not. Others,
above all the path loss at each frequency, depend on your cable and your
attenuator, so there is no universal number to compare against. For those,
record a baseline while the board is known good and compare against it later:
that turns "is 41.6 dB of loss at 2.4 GHz correct?" into "it was 41.5 dB in
March", which is the question you actually want answered.

Nothing here is destructive and every setting is restored on exit, including
after Ctrl-C.

#
# The only way a loopback can damage this board is RF power into the receive
# port, and the receive port is the fragile end: the AD9361's RX input is
# rated to about +2.5 dBm.
#
# THIS BOARD HAS A POWER AMPLIFIER, and sizing the limit for a bare AD9361
# gets it dangerously wrong. The PA is a Mini-Circuits PGA-102+, whose gain is
# strongly frequency dependent - 17.7 dB at 50 MHz, 15.9 at 800 MHz, 14.0 at
# 2 GHz, 10.4 at 6 GHz - with P1dB around +17.5 dBm. So at the bottom of the
# range the transmit port delivers roughly
#
#     +7 dBm (AD9361 at 0 dB attenuation) + 17.7 dB  ->  PA saturation, ~+17 dBm
#
# which is about 15 dB ABOVE what the receiver can survive. A loopback with no
# attenuator in it will damage this board. That is not true of a stock
# PlutoSDR, and it is why the floor here is higher than you might expect.
#
# Sizing the floor for the worst case - full-scale digital drive, 18 dB of PA
# gain, no external pad at all - and leaving 12 dB of margin under the +2.5 dBm
# rating:
#
#     7 + 18 - A <= -10 dBm   ->   A >= 35 dB
#
# So 35 dB is the floor, and sweeps start at 50 dB and only work downward
# towards it. At the -6 dBFS this script actually drives, that is about
# -16 dBm into a bare cable: 18 dB of margin. A 25 dB span is ample to prove
# the gain chain is linear, so there is nothing to gain from going louder.
# --min-tx-atten can lower it, and says why not to.
#
# The "without PA" variant of this board is 15-18 dB quieter, so this floor is
# conservative there. Being conservative on the quieter variant is the right
# way round.
#
MIN_TX_ATTEN_DB = 35.0          # never transmit with less attenuation than this

# distinguishable in a read-back. The ceiling has to be well above the floor or
# the linearity sweep has no room: with a single 30 dB pad the loop is strong
# enough that autoranging sits near 52 dB, and a 60 dB ceiling left only 8 dB
# of the 25 the sweep needs - so the measurement was silently skipped for
# exactly the setup most people have.

# Something else on the board may be moving the transmit attenuator.
#
# The Pluto rootfs is a ramdisk, but /mnt/jffs2 is persistent and
# /mnt/jffs2/autorun.sh runs at every boot - so a helper script put there
# survives reflashing the kernel, the device tree and the bitstream, and does
# not appear anywhere in the firmware source. A common one watches
# <tx device>/buffer/enable and sets a working gain a second or two after a
# stream starts, muting again when it stops:
#
#     ACTIVE_GAIN="-10.000000"
#     ... on 0 -> 1: sleep 2; iio_attr -o -c ad9361-phy voltage0 hardwaregain $ACTIVE_GAIN
#
# That is a reasonable thing to want and a genuinely confusing thing to debug:
# it fires once per stream, only while streaming, seconds after the fact, and
# at a value nothing in the kernel ever writes. It also silently overrides the
# gain the application asked for - which matters on a board with the PGA-102+
# fitted, where 10 dB of attenuation is roughly +13 dBm at the SMA against a
# receive port rated to +2.5 dBm.

the loopback:
  TX1 ---[ 20 dB + 30 dB pad ]--- RX1        and TX2 ---[ pad ]--- RX2

  THIS BOARD HAS A POWER AMPLIFIER (Mini-Circuits PGA-102+, 17.7 dB of gain at
  50 MHz falling to 10.4 dB at 6 GHz, P1dB +17.5 dBm). Flat out it delivers
  about +17 dBm into a receive port rated to +2.5 dBm, so a loopback with no
  attenuator in it WILL damage the receiver. Fit at least 20 dB; 40-50 dB is
  comfortable.

  This script itself never transmits with less than 35 dB of its own
  attenuation, which holds it under -16 dBm even into a bare cable. But it can
  only protect you from itself.

  Never run --loopback with an antenna on the TX port.
