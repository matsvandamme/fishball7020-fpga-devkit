"""Check the self-test's measurement maths, with no board attached.

A health check is only worth as much as its numbers. This asserts the parts
that could be silently wrong - amplitude calibration, image and harmonic
separation, the pure-Python FFT fallback, and the slope fit - against signals
whose answers are known exactly. It also pins the IIOD wire format for debug
attributes, which is what lets the BIST checks run without a shell.
