# This build reproduces the board's actual factory-default firmware (USB +

# identical to the real working firmware; uEnv.txt and the rootfs file list
# are content-identical (uEnv.txt differs only in U-Boot's internal env
# hash-table dump order, which doesn't affect boot behavior); the kernel's
# uImage and BOOT.bin are extremely close but not byte-identical, because the
# upstream repo's git history has been squashed to a single commit dated
# after this board's firmware was actually built, so a handful of source
# lines have drifted since (not recoverable from the public repo alone).

# long list of Xilinx-bundled cross-toolchain directories for every
# architecture Vivado/Vitis knows about (microblaze, arm, aarch32, aarch64,
# armr5, ...). Left in PATH for the rest of the script, this actively
# breaks the kernel build: its gcc-plugin infrastructure ends up loading
# ./scripts/gcc-plugins/arm_ssp_per_task_plugin.so against a mismatched
# libc.so.6 living under one of those Xilinx toolchain directories, failing

# kernel tree and manually inspecting PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH during
# development - this is Vivado's own settings script doing this, not
# anything this repo's scripts add).
#
# Fix: capture a clean PATH *before* sourcing env-vivado.sh, and use only
