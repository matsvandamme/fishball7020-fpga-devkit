# Isolating one FM channel in the FPGA

A worked example of putting real DSP into the AD9361 datapath: the board is
made to deliver **one** 200 kHz WBFM broadcast channel and nothing else, with
every other station annihilated in the fabric before a single sample crosses
USB.

The default configuration targets **102.1 MHz** (Studio Brussel), but the
station is a runtime control — see [Retuning](#retuning-to-another-station).

## Why the obvious approach doesn't work

The instinct is: tune the radio near the station, then lowpass the channel.
Two things break that.

**1. Tuning on-channel puts the radio's own defects in your audio.** A
zero-IF receiver like the AD9361 leaks its local oscillator into its own
mixer and carries a DC offset in the baseband ADCs. Both land at exactly
0 Hz — the centre of the channel, if you tuned on-channel. Standard practice
is to tune *off*-channel so the wanted signal sits at some baseband offset
and the junk at DC is somewhere harmless.

**2. But then a real filter cannot select it.** This is the part that
surprises people. A FIR with real coefficients, applied separately to I and
Q, has a magnitude response that is **symmetric about DC**. Ask it to pass
1.0–1.2 MHz and it passes −1.2 to −1.0 MHz just as faithfully — a different
station about 2 MHz below the one you want, mixed straight into your
demodulator, with no way to tell them apart afterwards.

Selecting a band that is *not* centred on DC needs complex coefficients, and
that costs four real filters instead of two.

**The cheap way out:** move the channel to DC first, then a real lowpass is
exactly the right tool. And if you choose the sample rate so the offset is
exactly **Fs/4**, that move is free.

Multiplying by `exp(-j*pi*n/2)` cycles through `1, -j, -1, +j`. Every
"multiply" is a swap of I and Q plus a sign flip:

```
n=0   x  1   ->  ( I,  Q)
n=1   x -j   ->  ( Q, -I)
n=2   x -1   ->  (-I, -Q)
n=3   x +j   ->  (-Q,  I)
```

No multipliers, no NCO, no coefficients, no block RAM. Two registers and a
2-bit counter.

## The arithmetic

Everything follows from two constraints: the offset must equal `Fs/4`, and
`Fs/8` (after the FPGA's ÷8 decimator) should be a whole multiple of 48 kHz
so the audio path needs no resampler.

```
Fs = 4 x offset                and       Fs / 8 = k x 48000
```

Solving both gives `Fs = 384000 x k`. For an offset near 1 MHz, `k = 11`:

| | |
|---|---|
| Station | 102.1 MHz |
| **AD9361 sample rate** | **4.224 MSPS** (= 384000 × 11) |
| Offset = Fs/4 | 1.056 MHz |
| **RX LO** | **101.044 MHz** (= 102.1 − 1.056) |
| FPGA decimation | ÷8 |
| **Delivered rate** | **528 kSPS**, channel centred at DC |
| Audio decimation | 528000 / 48000 = **11**, exact |

A detail worth knowing: **2.083 MSPS, the AD9361's floor, is too slow for
this.** Its Nyquist band is ±1.042 MHz and the channel's upper edge needs
1.2 MHz, so the channel would fold before any filter saw it. The old
flowgraph in this repo ran at 2.304 MSPS (±1.152 MHz) and had the same
problem. The rate has to go *up*, not down.

### The spur comes back, and the filter is what stops it

Offset tuning moves the LO-leakage spur off the channel — then decimation
brings it back. After the Fs/4 shift the spur sits at −1.056 MHz, and
1.056 MHz is exactly 2 × 528 kHz, so ÷8 decimation folds it **precisely onto
DC**: the centre of the wanted channel.

The only thing preventing that is the FIR's stopband depth at that one
frequency. It measures about −84 dB there, and the worst case anywhere in the
stopband is −78.5 dB, so the spur is comprehensively dead — but this is why
`gen_fir_coe.py` probes that exact frequency and prints it rather than
assuming. If you change the rate plan, re-check it.

## What was built

```
AD9361   LO 101.044 MHz, 4.224 MSPS
   |     wanted channel at +1.056 MHz;  LO-leak + DC offset at 0
   v
axi_ad9361   adc_data_i0 / adc_data_q0
   |
   v
rx_ddc  (ad_fs4_ddc.v)          <- NEW: x exp(-j*pi*n/2), 0 DSPs, 0 BRAM
   |     wanted channel now at DC;  spur pushed to -1.056 MHz
   v
rx_fir_decimator                <- EXISTING block, new coefficients
   |     321-tap lowpass, Fpass 100 kHz, Fstop 175 kHz, then /8
   v
cpack -> adc_dma -> USB         528 kSPS, the channel and nothing else
```

The whole TX path is unchanged, and channel 1 is untouched — but note that
channel 1 is *not* a usable second receiver while this is running. It has no
filter of its own and `cpack` clocks every channel on channel 0's write
strobe (`rx_fir_decimator/valid_out_0`), so with decimation engaged channel 1
gets a naive 1-in-8 downsample with no anti-aliasing. Its usable band shrinks
to ±264 kHz, and everything the analog filter let through — roughly ±2 MHz —
folds on top of that. Stock ADI behaviour, not something this change
introduced, but easy to trip over.

| File | What it does |
|---|---|
| `firmware/src/hdl/projects/pluto/ad_fs4_ddc.v` | the Fs/4 shifter |
| `firmware/src/hdl/projects/pluto/system_bd.tcl` | wires it in, repoints the coefficients |
| `firmware/patches/optional/0003-wbfm-channelizer.patch` | both of the above; **opt-in**, `setup.sh` does not apply it |
| `firmware/scripts/gen_fir_coe.py` | designs and verifies the coefficients (no MATLAB needed) |
| `firmware/scripts/coefile_wbfm_102100.coe` | its output, 321 taps |
| `docs/grc/fishball_wbfm_rx.grc` | the receiver, with no software channel filter left in it |

### Filter performance

321 taps, Kaiser window, quantised to 16-bit integers summing to 2^17 (the
stock DC-gain convention):

| | |
|---|---|
| Passband ripple, 0–100 kHz | 0.0019 dB |
| Stopband edge, 175 kHz | −113 dB |
| Adjacent channel carrier, 200 kHz | −78.7 dB |
| Folded LO spur, 1.056 MHz | far below the floor |
| **Worst case anywhere ≥ 175 kHz** | **−78.5 dB** |
| Cost | **96 of 220 DSP48s** measured (72 before the change, so +24) |

Do not raise the tap count hoping for more: past ~321 taps this filter is
limited by **16-bit coefficient quantization**, not by taps, and more taps
make it slightly worse. `gen_fir_coe.py` documents the measurements.

Taps are unusually cheap here because the filter decimates — the IP gets
eight input sample periods' worth of clock cycles to compute each output, so
it folds 321 taps onto a handful of multipliers.

These are measured, not predicted. A full synthesis and implementation run of
this design reports:

| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| DSP48s | 72 | **96** / 220 (43.6%) |
| Slice LUTs | 11 893 | 12 664 / 53 200 (23.8%) |
| Slice registers | 20 851 | 22 300 / 106 400 (21.0%) |
| Worst negative slack | — | **+0.292 ns**, 0 failing endpoints of 55 269 |

The Fs/4 shifter itself costs no DSPs, as intended; the whole +24 is the
channel filter going from 129 to 321 taps.

## Building it

The coefficients and the block-design change both need the FIR IP
regenerated, and `build_hdl.tcl` reuses an existing `pluto.xpr` rather than
re-running `system_bd.tcl`. So the project has to be deleted first, or the
build will quietly produce the old filter:

```bash
# run from: firmware/
./scripts/setup.sh          # if src/ does not exist yet
# --hdl-only reuses the kernel, U-Boot and rootfs from a previous FULL build
# and refuses to run without one - run a plain ./scripts/build_all.sh first.

# This example is NOT applied by default - it narrows RX channel 0 to one
# broadcast channel, which is not what a general-purpose build should do.
(cd src && git apply ../patches/optional/0003-wbfm-channelizer.patch)
rm -rf src/hdl/projects/pluto/pluto.{xpr,cache,gen,hw,ip_user_files,runs,sim,srcs,sdk}
./scripts/build_all.sh --hdl-only
```

`--hdl-only` reuses the existing kernel, U-Boot and rootfs, which are
unaffected — about 20 minutes instead of 70. Then flash `output/` as usual.

Worth checking before you wait for the flash:

```bash
# run from: firmware/
grep -A6 "^4. DSP" src/hdl/projects/pluto/utilization.rpt   # measured: 96 / 220
grep -A3 "Design Timing Summary" src/hdl/projects/pluto/timing.rpt
```

## Running it

Two rates must be set, and **the second one is what actually engages the
filter** — it drives `GP_CONTROL` bit 0, which selects the filtered path
through the bypass mux in the bitstream. Without it the samples arrive
unfiltered:

```bash
# on the BOARD
iio_attr -o -c ad9361-phy altvoltage0 frequency 101044000     # RX LO
iio_attr -i -c ad9361-phy voltage0 sampling_frequency 4224000 # converter rate
iio_attr -i -c ad9361-phy voltage0 rf_bandwidth 4000000       # analog LPF
iio_attr -i -c cf-ad9361-lpc voltage0 sampling_frequency 528000   # <- engages the FIR
```

Read the converter rate back. If the AD9361 landed on something other than
4224000, the channel is no longer at exactly Fs/4 and will sit off-centre.

The flowgraph in `docs/grc/fishball_wbfm_rx.grc` is written to do all of this
for you — **but as of 2026-09-17 it has not been run against hardware**, so
treat it as a starting point rather than a verified receiver. The FPGA filter
itself has been measured on the board (see above, and the README's end-to-end
test); it is the GNU Radio side that is untested. If you run it, please say so
in an issue or PR so this caveat can be removed.

It sets both rates from a Python snippet that runs after initialisation, because gr-iio programs
the AD9361 on its own and does not know about the FPGA decimator.

**The test that actually proves it works** is an A/B. Set
`cf-ad9361-lpc voltage0 sampling_frequency` back to 4224000 to bypass the
filter, and a neighbouring station should reappear in the spectrum display.
Set it to 528000 again and it should vanish into the noise floor.

Run on hardware, with the rate plan above and a 65 536-point transform:

| | Filter bypassed | Filter engaged |
|---|---|---|
| Out-of-band signal at −724 kHz | −66.5 dBFS, 37.8 dB over the floor | gone |
| Capture RMS | −49.2 dBFS | −78.6 dBFS |
| Peak sample | 23 LSB | 1 LSB |

29 dB of total captured energy removed, and nothing left standing outside the
passband. Note the measured noise floor also drops 22.6 dB, because decimation
folds eight times less bandwidth into the delivered stream.

Before that, the simpler check that the shifter is in the fabric at all: with
`rx_ddc` present the LO-leakage spur — which sits at exactly 0 Hz on any
zero-IF receiver and cannot be moved from software — appears at −1.056 MHz
instead. If it is still at DC, the bitstream you flashed does not contain the
change.

## Retuning to another station

The FPGA filter sits at DC, so it follows the LO — any FM station works at
runtime with no rebuild, as long as the sample rate stays 4.224 MSPS:

```
LO = station - 1056000
```

The `Station (Hz)` slider in the flowgraph does exactly this.

Changing the *sample rate* is the thing that needs a rebuild, because the
offset must stay at Fs/4 and the coefficients are designed for one Fs. If
you need a different rate, pick `Fs = 384000 x k` so the audio decimation
stays a whole number, set `FS_IN` in `gen_fir_coe.py`, regenerate, and
rebuild.

## Designing your own filter

```bash
# run from: firmware/scripts
python3 gen_fir_coe.py
```

Standard library only — no MATLAB, no numpy. It prints the response at the
four frequencies that decide whether the design works (passband edge,
stopband edge, adjacent-channel carrier, and the folded LO spur), checks
passband ripple and worst-case stopband, and **exits non-zero rather than
writing a file it cannot stand behind**. Edit the configuration block at the
top to retarget it.

`gen_fir_coe.m` is the older MATLAB equivalent. It designs an equiripple
filter, which reaches a given stopband with roughly 30% fewer taps, but needs
the Signal Processing Toolbox. Either is fine here; taps are cheap in a
decimating filter.

## A wrinkle worth remembering

`rx_ddc` sits *ahead* of the bypass mux, so it is always in the path. With
FPGA decimation switched off you get a 4.224 MSPS stream that is
frequency-shifted but unfiltered — not a raw one. That is harmless, and
useful for the A/B test above, but it will confuse you in six months if you
have forgotten.
